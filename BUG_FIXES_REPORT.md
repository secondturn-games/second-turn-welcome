## Bug #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Game Description Display

**File**: `src/app/listings/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 75-85)

**Severity**: 🔴 **HIGH** (Security Vulnerability)

### Description
The application was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render game descriptions without proper sanitization. This creates a direct XSS vulnerability where malicious HTML/JavaScript content in game descriptions could execute arbitrary code in users' browsers.

### Vulnerable Code
```tsx
<div 
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ 
    __html: listing.game.description.replace(/<\/p><p>/g, '</p>\n<p>') 
  }} 
/>
```

### Security Impact
- **Code Execution**: Malicious scripts could execute in user browsers
- **Session Hijacking**: Attackers could steal user authentication tokens
- **Data Theft**: Access to sensitive user information
- **Defacement**: Modification of page content to mislead users

### Fix Applied
Replaced the dangerous HTML rendering with safe text rendering that strips all HTML tags and entities:

```tsx
<div className="whitespace-pre-line">
  {listing.game.description.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').replace(/&[^;]+;/g, '')}
</div>
```

### Prevention Measures
- Always sanitize user-generated content before rendering
- Use React's default text rendering instead of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Consider using libraries like DOMPurify for controlled HTML sanitization if HTML formatting is required

## Bug #2: Memory Leak in File Cleanup Error Handling

**File**: `src/app/api/listings/route.ts` (lines 117-126)

**Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Performance/Resource Leak)

### Description
The error handling block contained a logic error where `request.json()` was called again after it had already been consumed earlier in the function. This causes an exception that prevents the file cleanup code from executing, leading to orphaned files in cloud storage.

### Problematic Code
```typescript
try {
  const body = await request.json(); // ❌ Already consumed earlier
  if (body.images?.length > 0) {
    const s3DeletePromises = (body.images || []).map((img: { key: string }) => utapi.deleteFiles(img.key));
  }
} catch (cleanupError) {
  console.error('Error cleaning up uploaded files:', cleanupError);
}
```

### Impact
- **Storage Leaks**: Uploaded files remain in cloud storage indefinitely
- **Cost Implications**: Increased storage costs over time
- **Performance**: Potential memory leaks in long-running processes
- **Error Masking**: The real cleanup logic never executes due to the stream consumption error

### Fix Applied
Modified the cleanup logic to use the already validated data instead of re-parsing the request:

```typescript
// We need to get the images from the validated data if it exists
try {
  if (validation?.success && validation.data.images?.length > 0) {
    await utapi.deleteFiles(validation.data.images.map((img: { key: string }) => img.key));
  }
} catch (cleanupError) {
  console.error('Error cleaning up uploaded files:', cleanupError);
}
```

### Prevention Measures
- Avoid consuming request streams multiple times
- Store parsed data in variables for reuse
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate cleanup procedures

## Bug #3: Weak Authentication and Input Validation

**File**: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (lines 6-25)

**Severity**: 🔴 **HIGH** (Security Vulnerability)

### Description
The user registration endpoint had multiple security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers:

1. **No Password Strength Requirements**: Accepted any non-empty password
2. **Weak Email Validation**: Only checked for existence, not format
3. **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: Could accept whitespace-only inputs
4. **No Input Length Limits**: Vulnerable to potential DoS attacks

### Vulnerable Code
```typescript
// Validate input
if (!name || !email || !password) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Name, email, and password are required' },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### Security Impact
- **Weak Passwords**: Users could create easily compromised accounts
- **Account Enumeration**: Attackers could probe for existing accounts
- **Data Integrity**: Invalid data could be stored in the database
- **Brute Force**: No protection against automated account creation attacks

### Fix Applied
Implemented comprehensive input validation using Zod schema:

```typescript
const registerSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().trim().min(1, 'Name is required').max(100, 'Name is too long'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email format').toLowerCase(),
  password: z.string()
    .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters long')
    .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/, 'Password must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number')
});
```

### Security Improvements
- **Strong Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- **Email Format Validation**: RFC-compliant email validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic trimming and length limits
- **Structured Error Handling**: Detailed validation feedback without information disclosure

### Additional Recommendations
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Add CAPTCHA for automated registration prevention
- Consider implementing email verification
- Add password confirmation field
- Log failed registration attempts for monitoring

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
1. **XSS Testing**: Attempt to inject scripts through game descriptions
2. **Authentication Testing**: Try various invalid inputs on registration
3. **File Upload Testing**: Test error scenarios during listing creation

### Performance Testing
1. **Memory Monitoring**: Verify file cleanup works correctly during errors
2. **Load Testing**: Test registration endpoint under high load
3. **Storage Monitoring**: Confirm no orphaned files after failed uploads

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics to Track
- Failed file cleanup operations
- Registration validation failures
- XSS attempt patterns in user input
- Storage usage trends

### Alert Conditions
- High rate of validation failures (potential attack)
- Increasing storage usage without corresponding user activity
- Errors in file cleanup operations

---

## Conclusion

These fixes address critical security vulnerabilities and performance issues that could have serious implications for user safety and system reliability. The implemented solutions follow security best practices and include proper input validation, output sanitization, and resource management.

## Additional Fix: TypeScript Build Error

**File**: `src/app/api/listings/route.ts` (line 98)

**Severity**: 🟠 **MEDIUM** (Build/Deployment Issue)

### Description
After implementing the initial fixes, a TypeScript compilation error occurred during the Vercel build process. The error was caused by implicit `any` types in map function parameters and insufficient type safety in validation handling.

### Error Message
```
Type error: Parameter 'img' implicitly has an 'any' type.
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 1
```

### Fix Applied
1. **Added explicit type definitions**:
   ```typescript
   type ImageType = {
     key: string;
     name: string;
     size: number;
     url: string;
   };
   ```

2. **Fixed type annotations in map functions**:
   ```typescript
   images.map((img: ImageType) => img.key)
   ```

3. **Improved validation type safety**:
   ```typescript
   let validation: z.SafeParseReturnType<any, z.infer<typeof listingCreateSchema>> | null = null;
   ```

4. **Enhanced null checks for optional properties**:
   ```typescript
   if (validation?.success && validation.data.images && validation.data.images.length > 0)
   ```

### Build Verification
The build now completes successfully with all TypeScript checks passing:
- ✅ Compiled successfully 
- ✅ Type checking passed
- ✅ Static page generation completed
- ✅ Ready for deployment
